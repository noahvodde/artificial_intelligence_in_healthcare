## Project description
In healthcare, you can see how machine learning can simplify manual processes, 
benefiting patients, providers and pharmaceutical companies alike. Google, for 
example, has developed a machine learning algorithm that can detect cancer 
tumors on mammograms. Similarly, Stanford University has developed a deep 
learning algorithm to detect skin cancer. In this project, we will look at how 
we can use machine learning to detect breast cancer. To do this, we will use 
logistic regression and the KNN algorithm. These as well as various evaluation 
methods are explained from the ground up in the notebook.

## Data Source
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)) 
we use for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was 
generated by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The features were calculated 
from a digitised image of a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Results
Overall, the KNN algorithm prevailed over logistic regression and became our model
of choice. In the end, we were able to create a good machine learning model that 
is able to detect breast cancer with an accuracy of **98%**.
